      <h2>Before</h2>
      <p>
        In 1869, the Canadian Government began creating a road and waterway system that was planned to cut through Saulteaux territory. In
        order to maintain relations with the Saulteaux peoples, Robert Pither was made incharge of communication in 1870. At this time there
        was not yet a plan to create a treaty as the government did not deem it necessary.
      </p>
      <p>
        In the same time period, Manitoba's Red River colony had attracted the attention of the government and they looked to establish
        Canadian sovereignty in that region. The military expidition they sent had to travel through the same territory. Once again an official
        was sent to notfiy the Saulteaux, this time Member of Parliament Wemyss M. Simpson joined Robert Pither, maintaining relations and
        ensuring troops they sent wouldn't be harmed on their journey. Wemyss M. Simpson informed the Saulteaux of the military expidition and
        offered to hire Saulteaux workers. The offer was refused, though the troops were promised to be unbothered, and a request was made.
      </p>
      <p>
        10$ per man, woman, and child anually for "as long as the sun shines." Ration of pork, tea, tobacco, and flour were also requested for
        celebrations. The Saulteaux made it clear that though they were open to treaty negotiation, that they would not be giving up their
        land, they merely want compensation for its temporary use. Simpson found the requests excessive and said the government would not agree
        to those terms. Canada's lieutenant-governor said the annual fee would only be worth paying if they were relinquishing their rights to
        the whole Territory.
      </p>
      <p>
        Late 1870, the Saulteaux said they would still be willing to negotiate a treaty but they still expected compensation for the use of
        their land. In 1871, the Goverment of Canada said they would further the treaty negotiations.
      </p>
      <h2>Negotiations</h2>
      <h3>1871</h3>
      <p>
        The Government of Canada set a limit to what could be offered to the Saulteaux in exchange for rights to their land. The amount set was
        a maximum of 12$ annually for a family of 5, with small amounts that could be added if a family exceeded that number. This deal did not
        interest the Saulteaux, who sent the three comissioners assigned to negotiations right back home. The comissioners, Simpson, Dawson,
        and Pither, promised to return the next summer with "presents," clothing and undetermined payment.
      </p>
      <h3>1872</h3>
      <p>
        Negotiations resumed in June, and the Saulteaux were increasing demands. This may have been caused by the discovery of gold and silver
        on their lands, making it more valuable. It may have also been caused by Saulteaux bands in the United States of America, who had
        already signed a treaty with that gave them more than Canada's government was promising. The Government sent Simpson to attempt
        negotiation once more, this time offering 25$ annually for chiefs and 15$ for band leaders. In October, Simpson arrived at Fort William
        to find few of the people he was looking for, as most Saulteaux had returned to their homes after hunting season. With the lack of
        people he was unable to hold a general council to propose the new offers, and treaty negotiations were once again put on hold.
      </p>
      <h3>1873</h3>
      <p>
        In June 1873, a they attempted negotiating a treaty once more, this time with desperation since the Canadian Pacific Railway relied on
        the treaty being formed. As such, the Government of Canada decided to negotiate while matching the offer the Saulteaux bands in the
        United States of America received. Meaning each person was to receive, 14$ for the cession of their territory, and an annual payment of
        6$-10$. The government gave the comissioners (Simpson, Dawson, and Pither) an absolute maximum of 15$ annually per person. Alexander
        Morris, the then lieutenant-governor of Manitoba and the Noth-West Territories, accomanied the comissioners to the North-West Angle in
        September. With them was a military escort, to insinuate that this was of the utmost importance. The Saulteaux delayed the meeting,
        even requesting a change in location, though the location change was denied.
      </p>
      <h4>October 1st, Governments terms as said by Alexander Morris:</h4>
      <p class="quote">
        I will give you lands for farms, and also reserves for your own use. … It may be a long time before the other lands are wanted, and in
        the meantime you will be permitted to fish and hunt over them. I will also establish schools whenever any band asks for them, so that
        your children may have the learning of the white man. … I will give you ten dollars per head of the population, and for every other
        year five dollars a-head. But to the chief men, not exceeding two to each band, we will give twenty dollars a year for ever. I will
        give to each of you this year a present of goods and provisions to take you home, and I am sure you will be satisfied.
      </p>
      <p>
        After contemplating the offer given overnight, Chief Ma-We-Do-Pe-Nais presented the Saulteaux's terms. 50$ for each chief, 20$ for each
        council member, and 10$ for each band, annually. Clothing, fishing tools, farming equipment, household items, food, and farm animals
        were also requested. It was emphasised that these were compensations for usign their lands, and not a mark of ownership. Morris refused
        these demands, saying that his offer he gave was completely fair. Chief Ma-We-Do-Pe-Nais knew about how other Indigenous people had
        their land taken away from them with few benifits. As such he was defensive.
      </p>
      <h4>Cheif Ma-We-Do-Pe-Nais replied:</h4>
      <p class="quote">
        I lay before you our opinions. Our hand are poor but our heads are rich, and it is riches that we ask so that we may be able to support
        our families as long as the sun rises and the water runs.
