      <h2>Before</h2>
      <p>
        In 1869, the Canadian Government began creating a road and waterway system that was planned to cut through Saulteaux territory. In
        order to maintain relations with the Saulteaux peoples, Robert Pither was made incharge of communication in 1870. At this time there
        was not yet a plan to create a treaty as the government did not deem it necessary.
      </p>
      <p>
        In the same time period, Manitoba's Red River colony had attracted the attention of the government and they looked to establish
        Canadian sovereignty in that region. The military expidition they sent had to travel through the same territory. Once again an official
        was sent to notfiy the Saulteaux, this time Member of Parliament Wemyss M. Simpson joined Robert Pither, maintaining relations and
        ensuring troops they sent wouldn't be harmed on their journey. Wemyss M. Simpson informed the Saulteaux of the military expidition and
        offered to hire Saulteaux workers. The offer was refused, though the troops were promised to be unbothered, and a request was made.
      </p>
      <p>
        10$ per man, woman, and child anually for "as long as the sun shines." Ration of pork, tea, tobacco, and flour were also requested for
        celebrations. The Saulteaux made it clear that though they were open to treaty negotiation, that they would not be giving up their
        land, they merely want compensation for its temporary use. Simpson found the requests excessive and said the government would not agree
        to those terms. Canada's lieutenant-governor said the annual fee would only be worth paying if they were relinquishing their rights to
        the whole Territory.
      </p>
      <p>
        Late 1870, the Saulteaux said they would still be willing to negotiate a treaty but they still expected compensation for the use of
        their land. In 1871, the Goverment of Canada said they would further the treaty negotiations.
      </p>
      <h2>Negotiations</h2>
      <h3>1871</h3>
      <p>
        The Government of Canada set a limit to what could be offered to the Saulteaux in exchange for rights to their land. The amount set was
        a maximum of 12$ annually for a family of 5, with small amounts that could be added if a family exceeded that number. This deal did not
        interest the Saulteaux, who sent the three comissioners assigned to negotiations right back home. The comissioners, Simpson, Dawson,
        and Pither, promised to return the next summer with "presents," clothing and undetermined payment.
