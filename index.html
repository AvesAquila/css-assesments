      <h1>Treaty 3</h1>
      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <p>
        Treaty 3, the North-West Angle Treaty, was signed on the 3rd of October 1873, by some Saulteaux peoples and the Government of Canada.
        The Treaty covers part of South-East Manitoba and extends into Ontario. Treaty 3 obtained terms that exceeded the previous treaties
        drastically and became the treaty which all others were based upon.

      <h2>Written and Verbal Promises</h2>
      <p>
        The Government of Canada promised to set aside reserves with one square mile for each family of five, and to set up monetary awards
        under the treatys terms. With a one-time payment of $12 per family in cash, and another $5 per person, annually. Funding for any
        necessary farming equipment and tools were also promised.
