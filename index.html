        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>
          Treaty 3, the North-West Angle Treaty, was signed on the 3rd of October 1873, by some Saulteaux peoples and the Government of Canada.
          The Treaty covers part of South-East Manitoba and extends into Ontario. Treaty 3 obtained terms that exceeded the previous treaties
          drastically and became the treaty which all others were based upon.
        </p>

        <h2>Written and Verbal Promises</h2>
        <!--this more detailed text is in a smaller font-->
        <p class="sm-text">
          <!--span is unique to this page, CSS is internal-->
          The Government of Canada promised to set aside reserves with <span>one square mile</span> for each family of five, and to set up
          monetary awards under the treaty's terms. With a one-time payment of <span>$12 per family</span> in cash, and another
          <span>$5 per person</span>, annually. Funding for any necessary farming equipment and tools were also promised.
        </p>
        <p class="sm-text">
          Dispite the treaty being drawn with careful attention, not everything verbally promised to the Saulteaux appeared in writing. The
          written version did not meantion any conscriptions exemptions, or right to the Saulteaux's mineral extraction on their reserves. It
          also failed to meantion government provisions of food for celebrations at the annual payments, and that relatives in the United
          States could be added to the treaty if they moved back into Canada within two years of the treaty being signed.
