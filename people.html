        Each council consists of member of Treaty 3 who have been chosen through a natural selection process which consists of representations
        for each of the four directions. They were chosen for their expertise, skill, and traditional knowledge. Their role is to bring forth
        the history, unique needs, and voices of Elders, Women, Men, and Youth.
