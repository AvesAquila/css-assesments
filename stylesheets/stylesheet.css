  You never want your text to be completely black as it hurts the eyes so alas here we have set our main text colour throughout
  body to be a dark green. The background colour is defaultly completely white which will also burn the eyeballs of the average human,
  so here we set it once again to a green, but this time a light green so you can still see the text.
  The font is also changed to an Arial font of default with the exception of if Arial is not installed on the clients computer. In which 
  case it will attempt to load the webpage in the Helvetica font. If all else fails whatever sans-serif font the client has on hand will
  be loaded. Font size too is changed, to 1.8rem, and as discussed previously, on an average monitor will be equal to 18px.
